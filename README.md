# WeRateDogs
In my analysis I have three different datasets used in analysing WeRateDogs dataset. This involves wrangling WeRateDogs Twitter Data to create interesting analysis and visualizations. There are 3 different datasets i.e (Enhanced twitter archive data, Image Predictions file and Additional data obtained via twitter API. In my analysis I have used both visual and programmatic assessment to assess my data. I have cleaned various data quality and tidiness issues in the datasets and merged the three datasets to one master data.
